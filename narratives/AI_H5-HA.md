abstract: "This narrative will showcase the current diversity of Avian influenza H5Nx viruses using sequences kindly shared by OFFLU and downloaded from GISAID (1st january 2022 - 1st september 2022. Only sequences within the reporting period of 1st February 2022 - 1st September 2022 are coloured by region and shown on the map."
