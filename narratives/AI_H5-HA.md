abstract: "This narrative will showcase the current diversity of Avian influenza H5Nx viruses using sequences kindly shared by OFFLU and downloaded from GISAID (1st january 2022 - 1st september 2022. Only sequences within the reporting period of 1st February 2022 - 1st September 2022 are coloured by region and shown on the map."

Countries of influenza A H5Nx sequences downloaded from GISAID and collected through the OFFLU network between the reporting period of 1st February 2022 and 1st September 2022 coloured by region.

Avian H5 global summary maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Analyses were conducted with reference sequences, data downloaded from GISAID (1st January 2022 to 1st September 2022) and shared by the OFFLU network. Sequences were coloured by geographic region. Only tips with sampling dates confirmed to be within the reporting period 1st February 2022 to 1st September 2022 were coloured by geographical region

# [Clade distribution](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HA?c=clade&d=tree&f_region=Africa,Americas,EastAsia,SouthAsia,centraleurope,easterneurope,southeastasia,westerneurope&m=div&p=full)

Avian H5 global summary maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Analyses were conducted with reference sequences, data downloaded from GISAID (1st January 2022 to 1st September 2022) and shared by the OFFLU network. Sequences were coloured by geographic region. Only tips with sampling dates confirmed to be within the reporting period 1st February 2022 to 1st September 2022 were coloured by clade

# [2.3.4.4b](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HA?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&f_region=Africa,Americas,EastAsia,SouthAsia,centraleurope,easterneurope,southeastasia,westerneurope&m=div&p=full)

Avian H5 2.3.4.4b global summary maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Analyses were conducted with reference sequences, data downloaded from GISAID (1st January 2022 to 1st September 2022) and shared by the OFFLU network. Sequences were coloured by geographic region. Only tips with sampling dates confirmed to be within the reporting period 1st February 2022 to 1st September 2022 were coloured. Amino acid changes within the HA1 were annotated on the nodes.

# [HI strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HA?branchLabel=aa&c=CVV/HI&d=tree&m=div&p=full)

Avian H5 2.3.4.4b global summary maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Analyses were conducted with reference sequences, data downloaded from GISAID (1st January 2022 to 1st September 2022) and shared by the OFFLU network. Strains which have been tested by HI assays at OFFLU laboratories are highlighted. Amino acid changes within the HA1 were annotated on the nodes.

Avian H5 2.3.4.4b global summary maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Analyses were conducted with reference sequences, data downloaded from GISAID (1st January 2022 to 1st September 2022) and shared by the OFFLU network. Sequences HIâ€™d by OFFLU collaborating laboratories are highlighted. Amino acid changes in the HA1 are annotated on the tree.
