# [Map View](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HAV4?d=map&gmax=986&p=full)

This map shows the location of influenza A H5Nx sequences downloaded from GISAID and collected through the OFFLU network between the reporting period of 1st February 2022 and 1st September 2022.

# [Phylogenies](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HAV4?d=tree&gmax=986&p=full)

Here we see the regional distribution throughout the phylogeny of sequences collected within the reporting period.

# [Phylogenies] (https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HAV4?branchLabel=aa&d=tree&gmax=986&p=full)

Here we have the phylogeny of the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses

# [HI data](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HAV4?branchLabel=aa&c=CVV/HI&d=tree&gmax=986&p=full)

2.3.4.4b strains HI'd by OFFLU in the last 3 VCM rounds.

# [HI data](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H5-HAV4?branchLabel=aa&c=CVV/HI&d=tree&f_CVV/HI=2fold,4fold,8fold,CVV,HI&gmax=986&p=full)

This page shows us how phenotype relates to genotype and HI titres for selected strains with amino acid mutations annotated at the nodes.

# [Mutations I](http://localhost:4000/mumps/na?c=gt-SH_22&d=tree,entropy&p=full)

Here we have coloured the tree according to a single mutation (residue 22 in
the SH gene) where there are two variants present in this dataset -- yellow tips
have a Methionine (`M`) at this position, while aqua nodes indicate Isoleucine (`I`).
