abstract: "This narrative will showcase the current diversity of Avian influenza H9N2 viruses using sequences kindly shared by OFFLU and downloaded from GISAID (1st january 2022 - 1st september 2022. Only sequences within the reporting period of 1st February 2022 - 1st September 2022 are coloured by region and shown on the map."

# [Map View](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H9-HA?d=map&m=div&p=full)

Countries of influenza A H9N2 sequences downloaded from GISAID and collected through the OFFLU network between the reporting period of 1st February 2022 and 1st September 2022 coloured by region.

# [Phylogenies](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H9-HA?d=tree&m=div&p=full)

Avian H9 global summary maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Analyses were conducted with reference sequences, data downloaded from GISAID (1st January 2022 to 1st September 2022) and shared by the OFFLU network. Sequences were coloured by geographic region. Only tips with sampling dates confirmed to be within the reporting period 1st February 2022 to 1st September 2022 were coloured by geographical region

# [Phylogenies](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H9-HA?c=clade&d=tree&m=div&p=full)

Submitted sequences and sequences downloaded from GISAID annotated by clade

Phylogeny of the G1 viruses with amino acid changes with amino acid changes annotated and coloured by country

# [HI data](https://nextstrain.org/community/acoggon3/AI@main/H9-HA?branchLabel=aa&c=CVV/HI&d=tree&m=div&p=full)

G1 strains analysed in HI by OFFLU and SJU with fold changes indicated by colour and amino acid substitutions shown. Strains previously tested by HI in previous VCM's have been highlighted.
